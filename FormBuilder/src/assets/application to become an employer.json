Entities will need to apply to become a Temporary Activities Sponsor through the Department of Home Affairs in order to be able to sponsor workers from participating countries to come to Australia. The Entity has three months to become a Temporary Activities Sponsor or the Department may revoke its provisional approval and the Entity will need to submit a new application if it remains interested in becoming an Approved Employer.</li>\r\n<li>If approved as a Temporary Activities Sponsor, the Entity will be offered a Deed of Agreement to become an Approved employer under the SWP. After the Deed is executed, the Entity may be able to employ seasonal workers under the SWP, in accordance with obligations imposed under the Deed of Agreement and Temporary Activities Sponsorship.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Instructions</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nPlease ensure you complete all parts of the application form. Any answers found to be false, misleading or inaccurate will result in rejection of the application and may result in the termination of any future Deeds of Agreement entered into by the parties.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPlease state your answers clearly and provide detailed information when lodging your application. Should you need further information please contact the Department via email: <a href=\"mailto:SWPapplications@dese.gov.au\">SWPapplications@dese.gov.au</a> or call (02) 6240 5234.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Application processing timeframe</b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nApplicants should allow about five to six months from lodging an application to when they can start recruiting seasonal workers, if their application is successful. The total processing time for step 1 is approximately 12 weeks and steps 2-3 take about 4-6 weeks.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOnce these steps are completed, all Approved Employers will need to complete an induction process before they submit a recruitment application to the Department for approval. The recruitment application includes a Welfare and Wellbeing Plan, Accommodation Plan, Labour Market Testing, Recruitment Details and an Offer of Employment letter. Workers cannot be recruited before a recruitment application has been approved by the department. The recruitment application approval process takes about 4-6 weeks. The total timeframe is indicative only. To ensure timely processing of an application, Entities should provide all requested information and to respond to questions fully and truthfully at the time of submission.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAn Entity may only apply for Approved Employer status twice in any 12 month period from the date of submitting their first application. Should the Department require further information in order to complete their assessment, the applying Entity will be sent a Request for Information through SWP Online via email notification, outlining additional information required and stating a closing date for response. If the Entity does not respond to the Request for Information prior to the closing date, the Department will close the application.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf an Entity becomes an Approved Employer and is found to have failed to provide relevant information or, provided dishonest or misleading responses and information in their application, the Department may seek to terminate the Deed of Agreement with the Approved Employer. Termination of the Deed will impact any other agreements or sponsorship arrangements under the program.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFurther information about the SWP can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.employment.gov.au/seasonal-worker-programme\">SWP Website</a>.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n<i>Please ensure you complete all parts of the application form.</i>\r\n<br><br>\r\nPlease state your answers clearly and provide detailed information when lodging your application. Should you need further information please contact the Department of Education, Skills and Employment via email <a href=\"mailto:SWPapplications@dese.gov.au\">SWPapplications@dese.gov.au</a>  or call (02) 6240 5234.",
